The Safe Mobile Money Transaction Monitoring & Fraud Detection System is an Oracle-based PL/SQL solution designed
to secure mobile money operations by detecting suspicious behavior, preventing fraud, and maintaining transactional 
integrity in real time. The system includes core tables for users, accounts, transactions, alerts, security logs, 
and holidays—supporting both operational data and compliance requirements. With robust PL/SQL components such as 
procedures for adding transactions, functions for fraud scoring, packages for automated risk evaluation, and compound
triggers to restrict weekday/holiday modifications, the system ensures strong auditing, security enforcement, and 
transparent logging. This project demonstrates the use of Oracle sequences, constraints, 
exception handling, and business rules to create a fully functional, secure, and intelligent mobile money monitoring 
environment capable of supporting analytics and future BI enhancements.
