# Design Decisions – Safe Mobile Money Transactions & Fraud Detection

## 1. Choice of Database

- **Oracle 26ai / XE** selected for robust PL/SQL support, triggers, packages, and advanced analytic functions.  
- Provides strong transaction control and security features suitable for financial applications.

---

## 2. Normalization & Schema Design

- Tables are in **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to avoid redundancy.  
- Separate tables for users, accounts, transactions, alerts, fraud detection, and audit logs.  
- Ensures referential integrity through foreign keys.

---

## 3. Fraud Detection Approach

- Real-time scoring system based on transaction amount, frequency, and destination.  
- Threshold-based risk levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).  
- Ensures immediate alerts for high-risk transactions.

---

## 4. Security & Restrictions

- **Weekday & holiday restrictions** on DML operations implemented using compound triggers.  
- **Audit logging** for every blocked or suspicious transaction.  
- User account status (ACTIVE, BLOCKED, SUSPENDED) controls access.

---

## 5. PL/SQL Features

- **Packages**: Encapsulate related procedures and functions for fraud detection and alerts.  
- **Triggers**: Automate transaction checks, enforce restrictions, and log actions.  
- **Cursors & Analytic Functions**: Efficient data retrieval and computation for BI reporting.  
- **Procedures & Functions**: Modular and reusable for maintainability.

---

## 6. Assumptions

- All transactions are in a single currency (RWF).  
- `destination_number` may be a phone or account number.  
- Negative balances allowed for overdraft.  
- Historical alerts and audit logs are permanent.  

---

## 7. Monitoring & BI Integration

- Tables structured for easy integration with BI dashboards.  
- Fraud scores and alerts can feed into visual analytics for risk management.

---

## 8. Performance Considerations

- Indexed primary and foreign keys for faster query performance.  
- Transaction triggers optimized to minimize overhead.  
- Data volume designed to handle real-world Rwandan mobile money transactions.
