The Safe Mobile Money Fraud Detection System generates important operational data useful for analytics. The BI component focuses on analyzing transaction patterns, fraud alerts, and system activity to support decision-making for system administrators and mobile money providers.

BI Questions the system should answer:

How many fraud alerts are generated daily?

Which users generate the highest number of suspicious transactions?

What time of day produces the most risky activities?

How many attempted (blocked) DML operations occur due to weekday/holiday restrictions?

What is the trend of high-value transactions over time?
